Guestbook -PHP code challenge

This is a simple guestbook, The users able to:
-Create an account (index.php)  There's the register form. the user can add name, email and password, then the account will be successfully added only if the email not used before.
-Login form (login.php) here if the user created an account he can easily log in using his email and password, then he can go to his home page (home.php).
-Write/Delete/Edit Messages, when the user can login he will go  to the home page that's show all the messages that he added before, in home page the user can delete and update and add new message
-Logout Button, (logout.php) here after clicking this button the user's session will be terminated and he will be redirected again to the index page.

I didn't add replies to messages because I didn't understand the using of it, why the user will reply to a message that he wrote it by himself
